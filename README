Here's my attemp to get smba1002 to boot 4.4.2 ASOP.

Copy to android/device/malata/smba1002/

run extract-files.sh or copy-files.sh that'll create your vendor directory

go back to source root

Shell Type: ". build/envsetup.sh && lunch"

Let it finish.

choose "vanir_smba1002"

Then

Shell Type: "mka bacon -j16" (replace 16 with whatever your machine can handle.)

Wait for it to get done.
Load it up and see if we can get a break LOL!!!!!!!
